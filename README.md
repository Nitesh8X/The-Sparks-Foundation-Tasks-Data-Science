# Data Science Tasks - The Sparks Foundation

This repository contains The Sparks Foundation task that I completed as an intern.
* Category: Data Science and Business Analytics
* Duration: 1 Month (November 2021)

The tasks which I perform where:

## Task1 - Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
Predict the precentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.

## Task2 - Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
Predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually
(iris dataset)

## Task5 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports (Level - Advanced)
As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.
(matches dataset, deliveries dataset, dashboard_ipl)

## Task6 - Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate)
Create Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly
(iris dataset)
